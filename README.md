# Boris Bikes

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a person,
So I can get a replacement bike,
I'l like to be able to report a broken bike

As a person,
So I can return my bike,
I'd like the docking station to accept my bike
